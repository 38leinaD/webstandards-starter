# Webcomponents Playground

My starter project for developing with the web's latest standards and [lit](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/).

## Usage

You just have to run:

    git clone https://github.com/38leinaD/webstandards-starter.git
    cd webstandards-starter
    npm install
    npm start

**_NOTE:_**  The command 'npm install' has been extended in the `package.json` to also run 'npx rollup -c'.

## Tips

For convenience, I have added a `devDependency` in the `package.json` to download browser-sync.
You should really have [browser-sync](https://browsersync.io/) installed globally. Run `sudo npm install -g browser-sync`.
I don`t want to download it for each project I am working on as it is such an essential tool.

The same holds true to me for `rollup`.
